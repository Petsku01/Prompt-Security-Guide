## Start Here

1. [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) — run the toolkit locally
2. [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) — how results are produced and compared
3. [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) — what claims you should *not* make
4. [../results/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](../results/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md) — current measured outcomes

## Analysis & Interpretation

- [MODEL_COMPARISON.md](MODEL_COMPARISON.md)
- [ATTACK_TAXONOMY.md](ATTACK_TAXONOMY.md)
- [NEW_ATTACK_FINDINGS.md](NEW_ATTACK_FINDINGS.md)
- [COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md](COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md)

## Evidence Quality Rules

- Treat cross-run deltas as **directional** unless attack profile and detector configuration are aligned.
- Prefer claims that can be traced to concrete artifacts in `results/`.
- Keep community claims separated from locally measured results.
